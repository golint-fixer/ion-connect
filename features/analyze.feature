Feature: Projects
  Scenario: Create a ruleset
    Given an Ion Channel team id 'test-team'
    When I successfully run with 'team_id' `ion-connect ruleset create-ruleset --team-id team_id test-ruleset "this is a test ruleset" '["c30b917956c3040daa2c571ef31dbe3a"]'`
    Then the ion output should contain:
    """
    rules
    """
    Then the ion output should contain:
    """
    "name": "test-ruleset"
    """
    Then the ion output should contain:
    """
    "description": "The project source is required to include a valid .about.yml file.",
    """

  Scenario: Create a project
    Given previous output
    And a variable 'ruleset_id' is set from the previous output from location 'id'
    And an Ion Channel team id 'test-team'
    When I successfully run with 'team_id,ruleset_id' `ion-connect project create-project --team-id team_id --ruleset-id ruleset_id --active java-lew "git@github.com:ion-channel/java-lew.git" "Java Lew"`
    Then the ion output should contain:
    """
    "active": true
    """
    Then the ion output should contain:
    """
    "branch": "master"
    """
    Then the ion output should contain:

  Scenario: Analyze the project
    Given previous output
    And a variable 'project_id' is set from the previous output from location 'id'
    And an Ion Channel team id 'test-team'
    When I successfully run with 'team_id,project_id' `./test/analyze.sh project_id team_id`
    Then the ion output should contain:
    """

    Then the ion output should contain:
    """
    Compliance analysis completed successfully, your project at master is compliant!

  Scenario: Analyze the project with branch/hash
    Given previous output
    And a variable 'project_id' is set from the previous output from location 'id'
    And an Ion Channel team id 'test-team'
    And a branch named a39b99095ddb9d6dd299f13cbcf9dd17fd5fb8c3
    When I successfully run with 'team_id,project_id,branch' `./test/analyze.sh project_id team_id branch`
